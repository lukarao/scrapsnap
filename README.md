# ScrapSnap
ScrapSnap is an app designed to help people recycle and dispose of trash properly. Users can point their phone camera at a piece of trash and recieve real-time feedback on what type of waste it is and how to properly dispose of it. This app was created as a submission for the 2025 Congressional App Challenge.
